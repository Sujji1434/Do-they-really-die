We got a pretty big age gap between left-handed and right-handed people purely as a result of the changing rates of left-handedness in the population, 
which is good news for left-handers: you probably won't die young because of your sinisterness. 
The reported rates of left-handedness have increased from just 3% in the early 1900s to about 11% today, which means that older people are much more likely to be reported as right-handed than left-handed, 
and so looking at a sample of recently deceased people will have more old right-handers.

Our number is still less than the 9-year gap measured in the study. It's possible that some of the approximations we made are the cause:

We used death distribution data from almost ten years after the study (1999 instead of 1991), and we used death data from the entire United States instead of California alone (which was the original study).
We extrapolated the left-handedness survey results to older and younger age groups, but it's possible our extrapolation wasn't close enough to the true rates for those ages.
One thing we could do next is figure out how much variability we would expect to encounter in the age difference purely because of random sampling: 
if you take a smaller sample of recently deceased people and assign handedness with the probabilities of the survey, 
what does that distribution look like? How often would we encounter an age gap of nine years using the same data and assumptions? 
We won't do that here, but it's possible with this data and the tools of random sampling.

To finish off, let's calculate the age gap we'd expect if we did the study in 2018 instead of in 1990. 
The gap turns out to be much smaller since rates of left-handedness haven't increased for people born after about 1960. 
Both the National Geographic study and the 1990 study happened at a unique time - the rates of left-handedness had been changing across the lifetimes of most people alive, 
and the difference in handedness between old and young was at its most striking.
